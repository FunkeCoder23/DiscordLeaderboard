I really dislike how teams will make you unmuted if you join with a low number of people

It really should just default mute, I keep forgetting that if I come to class early my mic will be on

GLUE ON THE ROACH BRO
OOOOOOOO SHIT
GLUE ON ROACH BABY
GLUE ON ROACH

God I love jaret barn, he's just so quirky and shy, like a cat

I'm sorry that I fucked up Now we go through it again Where I gain another pain And I lose another friend I fucked up It's getting hard to stand And I missed another plane 'Cuz I took another xan I'm fucked up 'Cuz of all the things I say I don't mean it But I think that I'ma say it anyway I'm fucked up I don't think I can be saved If I ever get redemption, it'll be inside the grave
